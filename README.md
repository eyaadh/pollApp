## ‚ú® Core Features

This application is packed with features to provide a complete and flexible polling experience:

* **Real-time Results**: Vote counts and rankings update instantly for all viewers without needing to refresh the page, powered by Firestore's real-time listeners.

* **Full Poll Management**:

  * **Create Polls**: Easily create a new poll with a custom name.

  * **Add/Edit/Delete Options**: Full control over poll options while in the 'configuring' state.

  * **Drag & Drop Re-ordering**: Intuitively re-arrange options using a smooth drag-and-drop interface.

* **Flexible Visibility & Listing**:

  * **Open vs. Private Polls**: Choose whether results are visible to everyone ('Open') or only to the host until the poll is closed ('Private').

  * **Listed vs. Unlisted Polls**: Decide if your poll should appear on the public homepage ('Listed') or be accessible only via a direct link ('Unlisted').

* **Complete Poll Lifecycle**:

  * **Configuring**: The initial state where the host sets up the poll.

  * **Voting**: The poll is live and accepting votes. Options are locked.

  * **Closed**: The poll is permanently closed and no longer accepts votes. The manage page provides options to view final results or delete the poll.

* **Secure Host Controls**:

  * **Closing Code**: Each poll is generated with a unique, secret code. This code is required to view private results, close the poll, and permanently delete it.

  * **Permanent Deletion**: Hosts can securely delete their polls and all associated data after they are closed.

* **Voter Experience**:

  * **Simple Interface**: A clean, mobile-friendly view for casting votes.

  * **One Vote Per Device**: Uses `localStorage` to prevent a single device from voting multiple times on the same poll.

  * **QR Code Sharing**: A QR code is generated for easy sharing and voting access, perfect for live presentations.
